Hey there :) I'm a software engineer interested in Machine Learning and Ethereum. Before that I studied Physics at Imperial College London.

I believe in technology, the role it has to play in growing economic opportunity, improve lives and how it can be used to augment humans in their activities. I love to build things, you can checkout my projects below and what I'm currently working on!

I'm curious and interested in the interface between humans and technology, and how at that interface technology can be used to upskill and give humans.

## Selected projects

### Natural language processing

- [Outboundly](https://www.outboundly.io/) - a GPT-3 powered sales support tool. Outboundly creates compelling personalised sales emails from a few user supplied prompts. The goal is to bootstrap startups, which don't have professional sales reps, to a good level of outbound messaging and help them grow.

### Crypto

- [BetterDeposits](https://betterdeposits.com/) - Escrow rental tenancy deposits inside a trustless Ethereum smart contract. Top 25 in the online Pioneer hackathon competition
- [Cover](https://coveroptions.eth.link/) - a decentralised options platform built on Ethereum, enables puts and calls on digital financial assets. Co-winner of a global Ethereum hackathon, [HackMoney](https://hackathon.money/)
- [zkSocialRecovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLQCfkMv6I0&ab_channel=ETHGlobal) - a novel, privacy preserving Ethereum wallet recovery technology which uses zero-knowledge cryptography. Co-winner of the Ethereum London hackathon, [EthLondon](https://ethlondon.com/)

### Computer vision

- [Tool](https://github.com/thomas-waite/computer-vision-thesis) for detecting plants from multispectral UAV imagery

## What I've been exploring recently

Machine learning, particularly natural language processing, and brain computer interfaces (super cool, checkout [Neurosity](https://neurosity.co/)).

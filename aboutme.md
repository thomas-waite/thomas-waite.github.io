title: About me
---

Hey there :) I'm a software engineer who's been working in the Ethereum space at [Aztec](https://aztec.network/) and before that I studied Physics at Imperial.

### Physics

I spent my time at Imperial learning about Physics - focused on experimental and computing subjects - and tried out a bunch of things in robotics, missiles and consulting.

Towards the end, for my thesis, I learnt some computer vision and co-built a drone based [tool](https://github.com/thomas-waite/computer-vision-thesis) that took steps towards detecting the plant species in a field. We attached a multispectral camera to the drone, imaged across various RGB and NIR wavelengths and then used a combination of supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques to segment the field contents.

### Ethereum

I then got very interested in what was going on in the Ethereum, did a short stint of [research](https://eprint.iacr.org/2018/1062) and then joined an Ethereum startup, Aztec. We were building a new, decentralised payments network without intermediaries.

Along the way, I was a co-winner of a couple of Ethereum hackathons - [Cover](https://coveroptions.eth.link/deposit) and [zkSocialRecovery](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLQCfkMv6I0&ab_channel=ETHGlobal) and built [BetterDeposits](https://betterdeposits.com/) for Pioneer.

### Now

I'm now exploring the latest goings on in machine learning and building [Outboundly](https://www.outboundly.io/) - a GPT-3 powered sales support tool.
